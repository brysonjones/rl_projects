# Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) Implementation

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing PPO from scratch, by referencing the original paper, 
and various other references. The algorithm is implemented in Python, and is  
benchmarked in various simple environments

## Resources
### Papers
* [Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347)
    * This is noted as the original PPO paper, which references the relative complexity of 
      TRPO, and how PPO is able to achieve similar levels of performance with less effort


### Articles


## The Algorithm
* PPO is an on-polcy algorithm, meaning that it evaluates and improves the same policy that
  that is actively being used to select actions
